Odaiba, My first cycling adventure in Tokyo after I got my ride. Up until now I only have been there by riding trains. I cannot tell how far a place is going by that long metal snake on rails. It felt far.

I took a little detour along the way passing Tokyo Tower, love the nice clear sunny weather. Still not used by the traffic rules around, took longer than I should. But it was quite a trip to reach the Rainbow Bridge.

As I got close to the entrance, there was an officer guarding the entrance. He told me to cross the rainbow bridge by foot and my bicycle has to be strapped on a small flat cart. There goes my excitement riding through the Rainbow Bridge.

It was still a view up there nonetheless.

I could’ve release the straps and roll on top of the bridge. But security cameras are everywhere on the bridge. So after you had your fun rolling around, somebody will be waiting for you at the end of the bridge with an unhappy face. Unless they weren’t looking at the cameras.

Another pose for the camera.

Many people were gathering in the park, better not to stay around there for too long. I continued straight away to Tokyo Big Sight. Another wobbly picture taken on my ride.

Saw the saw sawing through the ground, I didn’t saw it coming.

On my way home, I didn’t cross the Rainbow Bridge back, instead I went through the bridge closeby Tokyo Big Sight. Following the new route brings you to Tsukiji Fish Market. From there you just exited the bay area and back to the normal land.
