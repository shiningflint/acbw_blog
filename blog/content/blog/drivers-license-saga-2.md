After coming home from day 1, I need to start looking for practice questions. This time is not a reconnaissance mission. It's infiltration. There are tons of books being sold in amazon, but whaddaya know, there's an app for that! I quickly downloaded and start practicing right away. But wait, it's in Japanese. Oh well, the word play and trap patterns are all the same. It takes more time for me to learn it through non-english, but I'll grind it through.

## Day 2

2 weeks have passed. I've gone through my complain-and-rejection phase answering those practice questions. I've reached acceptance. I'm ready.

So let's repeat the whole process again. Went to the license center. Got a pencil and an eraser. sat down and contemplate wether my time practicing was useful or in vain.

Test starts. Answered. Handed out. And waited for the result. I failed again.
Oh well, I didn't put my hopes up high in the sky so it doesn't hurt when I fall. Until I got the result showing I was 1 point away from passing it. ｄａｙｕｍ！

Went back to the counter to retake my next attempt. My 4th attempt. Joked to the officer how I was this close from passing. They brushed it off and move on. Here I am sitting in the exam room. again.
