It is Autumn, getting colder for cycling around so I appreciate clear sunny weekends. Leaves are turning yellow, it is beautiful to see if you don’t have to worry about cleaning the fallen leaves. Since the Sunday was clear and sunny, time to get my red ride and yet again get lost in the beauty of the season.

This time, I wanted to go all the way to the shiba inu tobacco store clerk although knowing it has been retired from the job and living a life as a normal shiba dog. So the destination will be anti-climactic (yes I knew that from before even going), but maybe there can be something interesting along the way. So I opened my laptop and fire google maps.

Looking for interesting parks around Tokyo using Google Maps is simple. You see green, it will mostly be a park. When planning the route using google maps, I found an interesting greenery park alongside a river. I might pass through there on the way.

It was interesting. Parents strolling with their kids, elderly people enjoying the scenery, and cyclist cruising around freely. One that caught my eye was there are many photographers with nice expensive cameras trying to get the best shot of autumn 2016.

Most of the withered trees you see are sakura trees, planted along the riverside of the park. Looks like a good place to do hanami with friends or family.

Continuing the riverside path, it got narrower to the point 2 people cannot pass through alongside. The park path just ended and it is time to continue the route on the road.

Ain’t this a big floral shop, looks like it has its own garden.

Remember I said about my destination being anti-climactic? The trip has gotten more challenging once I covered most of the trip leaving the most fun part and paddle all the way to the destination just for the sake of it. Thoughts on going home after finishing the tour around the park went into my head.

It was very tempting to stop and go back. In that kind of situation, it is better to ask yourself “Will I regret it if I stopped and turn around?”. Asking that question to myself gave me motivation to turn the wheel some more until I see the place.

The reason why I kept going on is quite personal. I read about this blog about this shiba inu tobacco store clerk, then I watched more video blogs talking about it. Even though it got retired by the time I reached Tokyo, I still want to deal with my feelings just to let it out (sounds like confessing to someone you like).

The sun sets quicker compared to summer. Gotta go back home quicker than usual. Maybe it is a normal thing to have it in a four seasonal land. But in Indonesia the sunrises and sunsets are forever the same, unless something catastrophic happens like if the earth’s polar is shifting. So that concludes my trip of the day.
