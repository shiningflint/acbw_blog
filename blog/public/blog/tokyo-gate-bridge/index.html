      <p>Today’s bicycle diary is catching the sunrise around the Tokyo Bay Area. I decided to ride all the way to Tokyo Gate Bridge.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content1.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Sunrise and sunset are the moment most people say ‘The Golden Hour’. You can get the natural lighting coming from the side which is best for dramatic shots, even cheap cameras can take breathtaking pictures and make your friends say ‘wow’.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content2.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Taking pictures while moving on a bicycle can be a challenge, most of them turn out to be blurry.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content3.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Riding early in the morning when the sky is still dark is very quiet and feels serene. But as the sky color changes and you still on your way, you can’t help but feel the rush to reach the place before it’s too late.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content4.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The fun part of travelling alone to a place you never visited before is getting lost even though you know you’re very near the spot. Many people become frustrated when getting lost, but when don’t have to worry about time, everything feels fun.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content5.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Finally got it! But there is a gate blocking my way. At least I get to put my phone between the bars to get a clear picture.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content6.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Rode a little bit further and realized the fishing area is located inside a camping park nearby. Finally there, whew!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/main.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The other side of the bridge</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content7.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>There is something in humans when they gaze upon the sunrise or the sunset. Do you love seeing the sunrise/sunset?</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content10.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Continued along riding around the park and found this Observatory.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content11.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Don’t let the golden hour go to waste, pose for the camera!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content9.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The park is a campsite, I guess folks who fish here camps through the whole weekend.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content13.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The tower-like structure is the access to the bridge for pedestrians, you can see the stairs spiraling through. There is an elevator so I wonder if anyone actually use the stairs to go up and down the bridge.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content12.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>But looks like no sunrise sightseeing from above the bridge, the door opens from 10AM and it was still 7 AM at the time, what a bummer. I don’t think I will wait that long so back to home it is.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/wpacbw/uploads/2016/12/content14.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Still surprised on how nice the city is for cycling around. I wish they could make bridges crossable by bicycles.</p>
