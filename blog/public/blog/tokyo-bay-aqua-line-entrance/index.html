      <p>This trip was a big motivation test on myself. I never rode long distances, and this time I got myself a fixed gear bike. My legs were only trained a couple of weeks. The weather was not pleasing. The Aqua Bay Line Entrance is for cars only, there was no guarantee I could cycle around the entrance either. They might fence out the whole area and would left me disappointed.</p>
<p>“Maybe next week”, that thought came to mind. The weather had been cloudy and raining the past 2 weeks. But I had the time that day, just go with it anyway.</p>
<p>My first 5 kilometers are the most decisive part. Just knowing the line “Start Now!” is good, but actually make it into practice is a different matter. Imagining all the uncertainties was really demotivating. The only thing I know what I had was time. I guess time is that precious, it beats all those uncertainties and made me going.</p>

<p>So here I am, sitting on a restaurant in doubt to make the trip happen or go back home become a vegetable for the rest of the day once again.</p>

<p>The burger was delicious though!</p>

<p>Love those light posts!</p>
<p>The rain cleared up a bit, looks like a good sign. Got a little chat with the restaurant owner. I got motivated by telling what I was about to do for today. Finally opened the map and continue on. I gotta get it rolling!</p>

<p>Spun my wheel through Meguro River towards the Tokyo Bay area, stopped for a moment to get this picture.</p>

<p>Continuing on finding myself crossing a bridge, there was a railway along the riverside, I thought it was Yurikamome Line, but found out it was Tokyo Monorail line after doing some research in Google Maps.</p>

<p>Look at all these Shinkansen! Looks like all of them are Nozomi N700s.</p>

<p>Took a detour to a park close to Haneda Airport. You can see people with big shooters walking around trying to get an awesome airplane shot from below.</p>
<p>It was raining and stopping the whole time so gotta stop and wait for sometime before moving on.</p>

<p>A bridge that looks very familiar with the wangan track in the game &ldquo;Maximum Tune 5&rdquo;. Oh wait, because it is the bridge!</p>

<p>I reached the undersea entrance area. As expected, the seaside area is well guarded, or is it? I would be so disappointed if I gave up and turned back. Rolled around, peek some more, and what&rsquo;s this? A gap in between the fence and the gate! Time to sneak in and see what lies behind it.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2016/9/IMG_20160918_163553.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>As expected! I finally reached the far end of the gate. The pyramid like building is the roof of the tunnel entrance. Probably is where the maintenance people go in and out to the tunnel. But they fenced most of the seaside part.</p>

<p>In the distance, you can see the &lsquo;Tower of the Wind&rsquo;(風の塔). Sounds like something out of a JRPG game. Probably there is a big monster guarding the &lsquo;Wind Crystal&rsquo; that protects Tokyo Bay.</p>

<p>It was a rewarding trip despite the rain that drops occasionally. Headed back home afterwards for dinner time and killing the total distance of 70km ride. I didn&rsquo;t take the closest route and fooled around most of the time.</p>
