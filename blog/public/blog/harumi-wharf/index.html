      <p>It&rsquo;s February, although it was technically still winter, a very clear afternoon sky can be warm enough for you to go with just a T-shirt and a jacket. Being mindful not to stay outside until sundown, the zombies will *ehem the air will be too cold for only a thin jacket. I hadn&rsquo;t ridden my bicycle often during winter. Clear sky weekends gave me hope that spring is just around the corner. Time to clean up my bike and get it ready for the ride!</p>

<p>Ever since I crossed the Rainbow bridge, I had been curious on the pyramid-like shaped building across. It also seemed to be a seaside park right beside it. Checked on google maps, seemed to be a place called Harumi Wharf (or &lsquo;Harumi Futo&rsquo; 晴海ふ頭). So I obviously went straight away to satisfy my curiosity.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_111814.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The place is not so far from the Tsukiji fish market. It was awesome to know there is a place like this not very far from the busy landscapes of Tokyo. And what on earth is that thin futuristic-like structure? It looked like some cool rocket launchpad from afar.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_111939.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Oh, it&rsquo;s a trash incinerator. Like the design though</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_112254.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>By the time I got closer, there is nothing but constructions around. This made me worry a little. What if the whole place is still under construction? That would be uncool. I can see the pyramid like structure on the far end though. Don&rsquo;t give up just yet</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_112454.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>And whaddaya know. This place is hidden under the constructions around. This is awesome!</p>

<p>Admired the race of the day.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_112820.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Those stairs were quite a climb. wondered what&rsquo;s up there.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_112904.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Bicycle picture time!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_113155.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Climbing over the stairs and turning left, saw another pyramid object. Maybe is some kind of teleport station.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_113510.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>I grew up in Bali. A new toll road has been built above the sea. It is awesome to drive past by. But that was the first time a reclaimed piece of land has been built there. It gave investors ideas to reclaim lands on sea around Bali to start their own business property. May that be a mall, a recreational center, anything. It drove the Balinese folks angry.</p>
<p>I also don’t like the idea of turning a public beach that everyone can enjoy, into a private space that looks ugly and destroys the natural beauty of the place. I hated land reclamation.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_113555.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Land reclamation has been a common practice since a long time ago. Indonesia happens to be late of doing this practice. There are so many problems to solve, the rich people taking advantage of this situation to build their own assets. The rest of us who enjoy the natural beauty of the beaches, that can be enjoyed by everyone. I’m just rambling around in circles.</p>
<p>Coming to Tokyo made me change my perspective on reclaimed lands. I love strolling or cycling around the bay area. I guess the biggest realization is in Tokyo they reclaimed land to make a public space like parks and artificial beaches. It does not look natural, but it sure does looks pretty!</p>

<p>Took a glance down below. looked like there was a film recording going on. Costumes and all!</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_113754.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Another shot just for the sake of it</p>

<p>There was almost nobody around the place! Good for you people who are looking for some peace and quiet moments.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170219_135050.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Took the lift going up to the observatory.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170219_134934.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Inside the most top of the observatory. Enjoyed the view for a moment but it was that. Continued down to roll around the park right next to this port.</p>

<p>Continued my trip after visiting Harumi Wharf. Stopped by lalaport in Toyosu. First time visiting the place though.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_121752.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>It looks like you can rent bicycles here. Toyosu, being a reclamated land, is mostly flat. It&rsquo;s pretty fun to cycle around the place and enjoy the nice weather. Not to mention that cycling is a good exercise to burn all those calories.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_122051.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The view of the bay from lalaport Toyosu.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_122519.jpg" alt="" title="">
<img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_123055.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>I have to station myself to the stationery station.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_130753.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Short coffee break before continuing.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_142103.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>Continued along from Toyosu to Odaiba. I really love these bay walkways. Maybe for you people who are interested on running, this could be a very nice place to meditate while running alone.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_143353.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>This structure is the entrance of an underground tunnel that connects between islands. I always find it fascinating the fact that a road goes through underwater. The entrance looks like a huge skateboard ramp though.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_144017.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>A huge crane doing some digging. Lifting lots of underwater dirt along with tons of seawater. Imagine how much power that crane has.</p>
<p><img src="https://s3-ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/acbw/uploads/2017/02/IMG_20170204_145705.jpg" alt="" title=""></p>
<p>The last place to visit was DiverCity Tokyo Plaza. Roamed around a little enjoying the sunset, then going straight home before it gets cold. The sun is always something you miss during winter.</p>
